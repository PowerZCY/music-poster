This is more than wall art; it's a manifesto about music's democratic nature, how it belongs equally in symphony halls and subway stations, in recording studios and street corners. The distressed, layered aesthetic suggests the palimpsest of musical history, where each generation writes its songs over the fading notes of the past, creating something entirely new while honoring what came before.
